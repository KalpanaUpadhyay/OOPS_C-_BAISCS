Work of OOPS: To hide faltu ka complexity and make it easy for customer/developer 

ðŸ“’ C++ OOP Basics - Day 1 Cheat Sheet
1. Class
A class is a blueprint for creating objects.

It defines data (variables) and functions (methods) together.

class ClassName {
    // data members
    // member functions
};

2. Object
An object is a real-world instance of a class.

It accesses the class's variables and functions.

ClassName objectName;

3. Access Specifiers
They control visibility of class members:

public â†’ accessible from anywhere.

private â†’ accessible only inside the class.

protected â†’ accessible inside class and derived classes (we'll use later).

4. Member Functions
Functions written inside a class.

They perform actions like setting or displaying data.

Example:

void setDetails(string t, string a, double p) {
    title = t;
    author = a;
    price = p;
}

5. Why Classes & Objects?
Organize code.

Protect data.

Reuse code easily.

Represent real-world entities naturally.

                                        Book 2: "Wings of Fire"
ðŸš€ Summary Line:
"Class is the design, object is the reality."
