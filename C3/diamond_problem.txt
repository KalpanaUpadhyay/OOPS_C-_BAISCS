The diamond problem in C++ is a classic issue that arises in multiple inheritance when two classes inherit from the same base class, and a fourth class inherits from both of them. It looks like a diamond shape, hence the name.

🔷 Example of the Diamond Problem:
class A {
public:
    void greet() { cout << "Hello from A\n"; }
};

class B : public A { };

class C : public A { };

class D : public B, public C { };
Now if you do:

D d;
d.greet();  // ❌ Error: 'greet' is ambiguous
The compiler gets confused:
Should it use A::greet() from B or from C?
This is ambiguity — the diamond problem.

💡 Solution: Use virtual inheritance
class A {
public:
    void greet() { cout << "Hello from A\n"; }
};

class B : virtual public A { };

class C : virtual public A { };

class D : public B, public C { };
Now there's only one shared instance of A in D, so no ambiguity.

D d;
d.greet();  // ✅ Works fine. Calls A::greet()

🔑 Summary
Without virtual			With virtual
Multiple copies of base A	One shared copy of base A
Ambiguity in method access	No ambiguity, clean inheritance
