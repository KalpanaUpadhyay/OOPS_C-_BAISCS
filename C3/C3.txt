📅 Day 3: Inheritance in C++
🎯 Goal:
Understand what inheritance is.

Learn how a child (derived) class can use features of a parent (base) class.

Explore single inheritance (we’ll get to multiple/multilevel later).

🧱 What is Inheritance?
It lets a class reuse the properties (data + functions) of another class.

Helps in code reusability and modeling real-world hierarchy.

💡 Think of it like:
A Car class can be inherited by ElectricCar, SportsCar, etc.

🔄 Syntax:
class DerivedClass : access_specifier BaseClass {
    // new members or overridden functions
};
🛠️ Task: Create a base class Person and a derived class Student
🎓 Base Class: Person
name (string)

age (int)

Function: displayPerson()

🎓 Derived Class: Student (inherits Person)
university (string)

Function: displayStudent()


✅ Today’s Challenge
 Run and understand the output.

 Try creating another derived class Teacher with subject info.

 Try using protected instead of private in base to see access rules.

🧠 Quick Notes:

Access Specifier	Inherited As	Accessible in Child?
public	public	✅
protected	protected	✅
private	not inherited	❌
