📅 Day 1: Classes and Objects in C++
🎯 Goal:
Understand what a class is and how to create objects.

Practice access specifiers (private, public).

🛠️ Task: Create a Book class
Requirements:
Define a class called Book.

Add the following private attributes:

title (string)

author (string)

price (float or double)

Add public functions:

setDetails(string t, string a, double p)

displayDetails()

✨ Starter Code for You: (T1.cpp)
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Define the Book class
class Book {
private:
    string title;
    string author;
    double price;

public:
    void setDetails(string t, string a, double p) {
        title = t;
        author = a;
        price = p;
    }

    void displayDetails() {
        cout << "Book Title: " << title << endl;
        cout << "Author: " << author << endl;
        cout << "Price: $" << price << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Book book1;  // Create an object

    // Set details
    book1.setDetails("The Alchemist", "Paulo Coelho", 399.50);

    // Display details
    book1.displayDetails();

    return 0;
}
📌 What You Should Try:
Create two objects of Book.

Set different details for both.

Display both books' details separately.

🧠 Important Learning Points:
Class = blueprint.

Object = real-world entity created from class.

private = hidden data; only accessible via public functions.
