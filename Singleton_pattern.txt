The Singleton Pattern in C++ is a design pattern that ensures:

Only one instance of a class is created.

The instance is globally accessible.

✅ Real-World Analogy
Think of a government in a country — only one exists. Everyone accesses it, but only one instance should ever be created.

🔹 Key Features of Singleton:
Feature		Description
Single Instance	Only one object is created during runtime.
Global Access	It provides a static method to access that instance.
Controlled Creation	Constructor is private/protected to prevent other instantiations.
Thread-Safety	Must handle multithreaded access carefully.

🔸 Why Use Singleton?
Managing access to a shared resource, like:

Configuration manager

Logging service

Database connection

Hardware interface (e.g., printer spooler)

🔹 Basic Singleton Example:
class Singleton {
private:
    static Singleton* instance;

    // Private constructor
    Singleton() {}

public:
    // Prevent copying
    Singleton(const Singleton&) = delete;
    Singleton& operator=(const Singleton&) = delete;

    // Static access method
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        if (!instance)
            instance = new Singleton;
        return instance;
    }
};

// Initialize static member
Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr;
🔹 Usage:

int main() {
    Singleton* obj1 = Singleton::getInstance();
    Singleton* obj2 = Singleton::getInstance();

    if (obj1 == obj2)
        std::cout << "Same instance\n";
}


⚠️ Important Considerations:
Be careful with memory leaks (if using raw pointers).

In multi-threaded environments, ensure thread-safe access.

In modern C++ (C++11+), prefer using the Meyers’ Singleton pattern for safety.
